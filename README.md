# rumi keyboard

rumi is a fork based on [foostan/crkbd release `v3-final`](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/releases/tag/v3-final).

The latest Corne V4 PCBA only, making it almost impossible for manual soldering. Therefore, I forked the V3-final and made some modifications based on it to suit my needs.

## TODO

- [ ] Revise the Corne-Cherry V3 PCB design to allow for easier separation into a 3x5 layout
